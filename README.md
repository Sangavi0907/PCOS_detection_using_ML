PCOS, or polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a hormonal disorder that affects women during their 
reproductive years. Individuals with PCOS may experience long-lasting periods or infrequent 
periods. Male sex hormone androgens may be present at high levels in PCOS individuals. It is 
estimated that 8â€“13% of women who are of reproductive age have PCOS. Worldwide, up to 
70% of afflicted women go undetected. 

Numerous tiny fluid-filled sacs form along the ovary's periphery when PCOS is present. We 
refer to these as cysts. Follicles, which are little fluid-filled cysts, are where the immature eggs 
are found. There is irregular egg release from the follicles. We don't know the precise cause of 
PCOS. Losing weight and receiving treatment early on can reduce the chance of developing 
long-term issues including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It is feasible to develop PCOS 
without experiencing any symptoms. PCOS is characterised by irregular periods, polycystic 
ovaries, excess androgen, infertility, weight gain, exhaustion, altered mental state, disturbed 
sleep, and skin changes. Many people don't even become aware they have the illness until they 
experience difficulty becoming pregnant or start accumulating weight for no apparent reason. 
Mid-stage PCOS is another possibility, in which symptoms are not severe enough to be 
noticeable. 

Early PCOS discovery can lessen the severity of the illness or, in some cases, even cure it. 
Therefore, using patient data, a machine learning model is required to identify the presence of 
PCOS. The primary goal is to identify a reliable machine learning model for patient 
PCOS diagnosis.
